      <title>Go-Based Malware Deploys XMRig Miner on Linux Hosts via Redis Configuration Abuse</title>
      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/go-based-malware-deploys-xmrig-miner-on.html</link>
      <description>The article discusses two separate cybersecurity threats. The first is RedisRaider, a Linux cryptojacking campaign targeting publicly accessible Redis servers. The attackers use a bespoke scanner to identify vulnerable systems and inject malicious cron jobs using Redis's SET command. The end goal is to drop an XMRig miner on compromised systems. The second threat is a targeted campaign exploiting legacy authentication protocols in Microsoft Entra ID, bypassing defenses like MFA and Conditional Access.</description>
