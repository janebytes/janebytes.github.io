      <title>The Persistence Problem: Why Exposed Credentials Remain Unfixed—and How to Change That</title>
      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/the-persistence-problem-why-exposed.html</link>
      <description>The article discusses the persistence of exposed company secrets in public GitHub repositories, with many credentials remaining valid for years after detection. This creates an expanding attack surface that organizations often fail to address due to limited visibility, operational complexity, and technical limitations.

FYSA: Threat actors can exploit exposed database credentials to exfiltrate or corrupt data, while cloud keys grant access to infrastructure, code, and customer data. Organizations should prioritize rapid remediation and adopt modern secrets management practices, including short-lived, dynamic credentials and automation, to reduce the risks posed by exposed secrets.</description>
