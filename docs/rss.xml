      <title>⚡ Weekly Recap: Airline Hacks, Citrix 0-Day, Outlook Malware, Banking Trojans and more</title>
      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/weekly-recap-airline-hacks-citrix-0-day.html</link>
      <description>The provided article appears to be a cybersecurity news roundup featuring various security-related topics, including vulnerabilities, attacks, and best practices. There are no specific software, hardware, or firmware products being discussed that I could identify as vulnerable.

However, some of the topics mentioned in the article do warrant attention from a cybersecurity perspective. For instance, the discussion on memory-safe languages (MSLs) such as Rust highlights the importance of language-level protections to mitigate memory-related vulnerabilities. Additionally, the mention of ultrasonic covert communication attacks and the use of smartwatches as receivers for these types of attacks serves as a reminder of the need for robust security measures in air-gapped environments.

In general, it is essential to stay informed about emerging cybersecurity threats and best practices to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data.</description>

      <title>ESET Warns Cybercriminals Are Targeting NFC Data for Contactless Payments</title>
      <link>https://gbhackers.com/eset-warns-cybercriminals-are-targeting-nfc-data/</link>
      <description>The article discusses a sophisticated attack vector exploiting Near Field Communication (NFC) data, initially targeting Czech banking customers but now spreading worldwide. Cybercriminals are using a tool called NFCGate to capture card data when victims place their cards near their smartphones, enabling attackers to emulate the card on their devices for unauthorized transactions or cash withdrawals. The attacks rely on social engineering and phishing attempts, and users can mitigate risks by setting low limits on contactless payment transactions, using RFID blockers, and deploying robust cybersecurity solutions like ESET HOME Security.</description>
