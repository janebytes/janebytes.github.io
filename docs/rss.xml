      <description>Cybercriminals are using Search Engine Optimization (SEO) poisoning techniques to trick IT administrators into downloading malicious software, which can lead to devastating consequences such as data exfiltration and ransomware. The attackers establish persistent access, evade detection by masquerading traffic over common ports, and systematically target mission-critical assets. To combat this, experts recommend a robust "Defense in Depth" approach, including hardening access to critical assets, deploying Endpoint Detection and Response solutions, and implementing application allow-listing.</description>
