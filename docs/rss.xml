      <title>GoldMelody’s Hidden Chords: Initial Access Broker In-Memory IIS Modules Revealed</title>
      <link>https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/initial-access-broker-exploits-leaked-machine-keys/</link>
      <description>This article appears to be a threat brief on an Initial Access Broker (IAB) group known as TGR-CRI-0045, which is leveraging in-memory IIS techniques for persistent access. The article discusses the group's use of ASP.NET View State deserialization vulnerabilities and its exploitation of exposed Machine Keys.

The article provides details on the group's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including the use of reflective .NET assemblies, TxPortMap tooling, and GodPotato privilege escalation technique. It also discusses the group's post-exploitation activities, such as code injection attacks using publicly disclosed ASP.NET machine keys.

The article concludes by highlighting the need for organizations to prioritize identifying and remediating compromised Machine Keys, as outlined by Microsoft. It also mentions that Palo Alto Networks customers are better protected from these threats through various products and features.

Overall, this article is not discussing a specific vulnerability (software, hardware, or firmware), but rather providing insights on an IAB group's TTPs and the need for organizations to be aware of these types of attacks.</description>

      <title>Over 40 Malicious Firefox Extensions Target Cryptocurrency Wallets, Stealing User Assets</title>
      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/07/over-40-malicious-firefox-extensions.html</link>
      <description>Vulnerable Product: Mozilla Firefox; CVE(s): None; Summary: The article describes a large-scale campaign involving over 40 malicious browser extensions for Mozilla Firefox, designed to steal cryptocurrency wallet secrets. The extensions impersonate legitimate wallet tools and employ tactics such as artificially inflating their popularity and cloning open-source code to extract wallet keys and seed phrases from targeted websites.

FYSA: The article highlights a sophisticated threat actor group using a low-effort, high-impact approach to steal users' digital assets by distributing malicious browser extensions. The campaign's success relies on the ability of these extensions to operate inside the user's browser, making them harder to detect or block with traditional endpoint tools.</description>

      <title>Apache Under the Lens: Tomcat’s Partial PUT and Camel’s Header Hijack</title>
      <link>https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/apache-cve-2025-24813-cve-2025-27636-cve-2025-29891/</link>
      <description>FYSA:

The article discusses multiple vulnerabilities in Apache Tomcat and Apache Camel, including CVE-2025-24813, CVE-2025-27636, and CVE-2025-29891. The vulnerabilities allow for potential remote code execution, which can lead to data breaches and lateral movement within the network.

The analysis reveals that most of the exploit attempts use a six-character session name and a specific value for the Content-Range header. The Nuclei Scanner, a freely available scanner, is being used by attackers to check for the vulnerability.

Palo Alto Networks customers are protected from these threats through various products, including the Next Generation Firewall with an Advanced Threat Prevention subscription, Advanced URL Filtering, and Cortex Xpanse.

The article also highlights the importance of immediate action in addressing these vulnerabilities, as they can be exploited by less-skilled adversaries.</description>
