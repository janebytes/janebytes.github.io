      <title>New Tor Oniux tool anonymizes any Linux app's network traffic</title>
      <link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-tor-oniux-tool-anonymizes-any-linux-apps-network-traffic/</link>
      <description>Tor has announced Oniux, a command-line tool for routing any Linux application securely through the Tor network using Linux namespaces, providing kernel-enforced isolation and preventing data leaks.
