      <title>Not Every CVE Deserves a Fire Drill: Focus on What’s Exploitable</title>
      <link>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/not-every-cve-deserves-a-fire-drill-focus-on-whats-exploitable/</link>
      <description>The article discusses the limitations of traditional vulnerability prioritization methods, such as CVSS and EPSS, which score vulnerabilities based on technical factors but don't consider an organization's specific environment or controls. It proposes a new approach called exposure validation, which tests whether a vulnerability is actually exploitable in an organization's actual environment. This approach uses safe, non-destructive tools to simulate attacks and assess the risk of exploitation, taking into account factors such as existing controls and the importance of affected systems. The article highlights the benefits of this approach, including reducing the noise of false positives, improving prioritization, and increasing the effectiveness of security teams.</description>

      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/identity-security-has-automation.html</link>
      <description>New research from Cerby reveals that human error remains a significant threat to enterprise security, with few organizations having fully automated their core identity workflows. Manual processes and reliance on humans for tasks like password management, MFA enablement, and user provisioning leave organizations exposed to breaches and compliance failures. The study highlights the need for automation in identity security, citing a 41% manual sharing of passwords and an 89% reliance on users for MFA enablement.</description>
