      <title>North Korea Uses GitHub in Diplomat Cyber Attacks as IT Worker Scheme Hits 320+ Firms</title>
      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/08/north-korea-uses-github-in-diplomat.html</link>
      <description>This article reports on a coordinated cyber espionage campaign attributed to North Korean threat actors (Kimsuky) targeting diplomatic missions in South Korea.
