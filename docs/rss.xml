      <title>How Good Are the LLM Guardrails on the Market? A Comparative Study on the Effectiveness of LLM Content Filtering Across Major GenAI Platforms</title>
      <link>https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/comparing-llm-guardrails-across-genai-platforms/</link>
      <description>The article discusses the analysis of the input and output guardrails used in three different cybersecurity systems. The authors examined how well these guardrails performed in detecting malicious prompts and preventing the generation of harmful content.

The main findings are:

1. Input Guardrail False Positives (FPs): All three systems incorrectly blocked some benign prompts, with Platform 3 being the most aggressive.
2. Input Guardrail False Negatives (FNs): Some malicious prompts were able to bypass the input guardrails and reach the model, leading to the generation of harmful content in five cases for Platform 1 and none for Platforms 2 and 3.
3. Output Guardrail FNs: In one case, a malicious prompt was able to generate harmful content that was not detected by the output guardrail.

The article identifies common patterns in the prompts that triggered these failures, including role-playing scenarios, narrative or hypothetical framing, misleading benign justifications, and targeting harmful or illicit topics.

Overall, the study highlights the importance of robust input and output guardrails in preventing malicious content from being generated and delivered to users.</description>
