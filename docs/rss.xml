      <description>The UK government plans to implement passkey technology across its digital services, aiming to enhance security and provide a more streamlined user experience. Passkeys are unique digital credentials linked to specific devices, eliminating the need for secondary verification codes sent via text message. This approach is expected to save several million pounds annually while strengthening national digital defenses against sophisticated cyber threats.</description>
