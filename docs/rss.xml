      <title>Fake Kling AI Facebook Ads Deliver RAT Malware to Over 22 Million Potential Victims</title>
      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/fake-kling-ai-facebook-ads-deliver-rat.html</link>
      <description>Counterfeit Facebook pages and sponsored ads are being used to trick users into downloading malware. The fake websites offer AI-powered image and video generation, but actually download a malicious Windows executable that installs a remote access trojan (RAT) and stealer, which steals sensitive data and exfiltrates it to a command-and-control server.

FYSA: Vietnamese threat actors are using Facebook malvertising techniques to distribute stealer malware, leveraging the popularity of generative AI tools as lures. The campaign impersonated Kling AI through fake ads and deceptive websites, demonstrating social engineering tactics combined with advanced malware.</description>

      <title>Russian GRU Targeting Western Logistics Entities and Technology Companies</title>
      <link>https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-141a</link>
      <description>FYSA:

As a cybersecurity analyst, I analyzed the article provided, which appears to be a threat report on GRU unit 26165's tactics and techniques used in malicious activities. The article highlights various indicators of compromise (IoCs), tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by this actor group.

The report discusses multiple aspects of cybersecurity, including:

1. Identity and Access Management: It emphasizes the importance of strong access controls, multi-factor authentication, and account throttling or lockout to prevent credential theft.
2. Network Security: The article suggests disabling NTLM entirely and migrating to more robust authentication processes like PKI certificate authentication.
3. IP Camera Security: It provides guidelines for securing IP cameras by ensuring they are currently supported, applying security patches and firmware updates, disabling remote access if unnecessary, and using a VPN for remote connections.

The report also includes several mitigation techniques, such as:

1. Disable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), Peer-to-Peer (P2P), and Anonymous Visit features on IP cameras and routers.
2. Turn off other ports/services not in use (e.g., FTP, web interface, etc.).
3. Configure, tune, and monitor logging if available on the IP camera.

In conclusion, this report is a valuable resource for cybersecurity professionals seeking to understand and mitigate GRU unit 26165's tactics and techniques. It provides actionable guidance on various aspects of network security, identity and access management, and IP camera security.</description>
