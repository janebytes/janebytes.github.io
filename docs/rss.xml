      <title>DRAT V2: Updated DRAT Emerges in TAG-140’s Arsenal</title>
      <link>https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/drat-v2-updated-drat-emerges-tag-140s-arsenal</link>
      <description>This article appears to be a cybersecurity analysis report on the DRAT V2 malware used by the TAG-140 group. The report provides an in-depth analysis of the malware's technical and operational details, including its command structure, C2 obfuscation techniques, and communication protocol.

The report highlights several key differences between the original DRAT and DRAT V2 variants, such as the use of different command naming conventions, changes to system information response formats, and modifications to C2 obfuscation patterns. The analysis also notes that while both versions use Base64 encoding for C2 information, DRAT V2 prepends additional strings to the IP address prior to encoding, which may serve as rudimentary integrity checks or prevent trivial decoding by analysts and automated tools.

The report provides several detection rules and guidelines for security teams to detect and monitor TAG-140 activity, including Snort rules for detecting outbound C2 communication, Sigma rules for detecting persistence via registry run keys, and YARA rules for detecting files containing strings associated with the BroaderAspect malware. The analysis concludes that while DRAT V2 exhibits limited use of defensive evasion or anti-analysis techniques, security teams should remain vigilant and anticipate continued experimentation with malware tooling and infection chains.</description>
