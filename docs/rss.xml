      <description>New research from Cerby reveals that human error remains a significant threat to enterprise security, with few organizations having fully automated their core identity workflows. Manual processes and reliance on humans for tasks like password management, MFA enablement, and user provisioning leave organizations exposed to breaches and compliance failures. The study highlights the need for automation in identity security, citing a 41% manual sharing of passwords and an 89% reliance on users for MFA enablement.</description>

      <title>Russian GRU Targeting Western Logistics Entities and Technology Companies</title>
      <link>https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-141a</link>
      <description>FYSA:

As a cybersecurity analyst, I analyzed the article provided, which appears to be a threat report on GRU unit 26165's tactics and techniques used in malicious activities. The article highlights various indicators of compromise (IoCs), tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by this actor group.

The report discusses multiple aspects of cybersecurity, including:

1. Identity and Access Management: It emphasizes the importance of strong access controls, multi-factor authentication, and account throttling or lockout to prevent credential theft.
2. Network Security: The article suggests disabling NTLM entirely and migrating to more robust authentication processes like PKI certificate authentication.
3. IP Camera Security: It provides guidelines for securing IP cameras by ensuring they are currently supported, applying security patches and firmware updates, disabling remote access if unnecessary, and using a VPN for remote connections.

The report also includes several mitigation techniques, such as:

1. Disable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), Peer-to-Peer (P2P), and Anonymous Visit features on IP cameras and routers.
2. Turn off other ports/services not in use (e.g., FTP, web interface, etc.).
