      <link>https://gbhackers.com/akamai-reveals-new-strategies-for-defenders/</link>
      <description>Akamai has developed two proactive strategies to disrupt malicious cryptominer operations by exploiting the design of common mining topologies. The first strategy targets mining proxies by submitting invalid mining job results, while the second method temporarily bans wallet addresses by flooding login requests. These techniques can halt botnet-driven cryptomining campaigns and potentially impact other cryptocurrencies.</description>

      <title>Beware the Hidden Risk in Your Entra Environment</title>
      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/beware-hidden-risk-in-your-entra.html</link>
      <description>Vulnerable Product: Microsoft Entra ID; CVE(s): None; Summary: A gap in access control in Microsoft Entra's subscription handling allows guest users to create and transfer subscriptions into the tenant they are invited into, while maintaining full ownership rights. This privilege escalation tactic allows a guest user to gain a foothold in an environment where they should only have limited access.

FYSA: The article discusses a surprising risk in Microsoft Entra ID that can allow guest users to escalate their privileges by creating and controlling subscriptions. The vulnerability is due to the fact that Microsoft's billing permissions are scoped at the billing account level, rather than the Entra directory. This allows an attacker with the right billing role to spin up or transfer subscriptions from their home tenant to gain control inside a target tenant.</description>
