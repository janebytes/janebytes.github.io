      <title>Identity Security Has an Automation Problem—And It's Bigger Than You Think</title>
      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/identity-security-has-automation.html</link>
      <description>New research from Cerby reveals that human error remains a significant threat to enterprise security, with few organizations having fully automated their core identity workflows. Manual processes and reliance on humans for tasks like password management, MFA enablement, and user provisioning leave organizations exposed to breaches and compliance failures. The study highlights the need for automation in identity security, citing a 41% manual sharing of passwords and an 89% reliance on users for MFA enablement.</description>
